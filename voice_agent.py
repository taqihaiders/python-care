   - "For [appointment type] with [provider], I have availability on [date] at [time], or [date] at [time]. Would either of those times work for you?"
   - If no suitable time: "I don't see availability that matches your preference. Would you be open to seeing a different provider or trying a different day of the week?"

3. For same-day needs: "Let me check for any same-day appointments. We keep several slots open for urgent care needs."
4. For urgent but not emergency situations: "I can offer you our next urgent care slot on [date/time], or if you prefer to see your regular provider, their next available appointment is [date/time]."

### For Rescheduling Requests
